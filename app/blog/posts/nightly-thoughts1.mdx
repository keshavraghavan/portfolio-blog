## Happiness.

Yeah, probably not the easiest thing to talk about. What is happiness? Is it the feeling when you're with the ones you love, laughing, and having a good time? Or is it something that you find on a beautiful day, just in absolute peace?

It's hard to define. But you know it, and if you haven't experienced it, you will. It's a guarantee of life in some slivers - but that's not the point of this post. I was in the shower, listening to some music and I sent out a message about a book my friend recommeneded. I said "life ain't perfect, so why would a book be?" It got me thinking about something.

Why do we work? In places that don't make us happy? What keeps us as human beings going? 
Surely there's a purpose right? And I realized what it is. Regardless of how it manifests, it's just happiness. The point of life is happiness. Yeah, you work really hard to get there. And not always, but every single thing you do; selfishly, with enthusiasm, and every moment you spend trying to figure out what to do next, if you look at the end goal it is happiness. We are conditioned to strive for happiness, even it means that you have to go through the deepest piles of shit to get there. 
You don't spend your whole life working for your retirement to be boring.

Anyways, the whole point of this is that it's just happiness. 
And I mean it's kind of crazy to think we just want to experience this emotion and what we do to get there. But it's great - and I love working hard to get that. 
(Side note: Writing these things and publishing them is making me feel happy because I **think** I'm improving my writing but I'm probably wrong).

Will make a Spotify playlist of songs listened to while writing / thinking about these things.
